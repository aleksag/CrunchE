Crunch-E is a keychain form factor music-making platform that is both limited and limitless. The current software supports 4 tracks, 10 synth instruments, and 2 drum machine banks, but who knows where developers will take the open-source software next?

Crunch-E hardware comes in a few flavors. You can build it yourself on the cheap, use the schematic to design your own PCB, or purchase ready-made units from this site.

Crunch-E hardware consists of an ESP32 microprocessor, a MAX98357A I2S sound amplifier, 4 LEDs, and an LM1117 power regulator. It can be obtained in a fully manufactured and very sleek form, or it can be built out of development and breakout boards (ESP32 dev boards, MAX98357 breakout boards, and Arduino keypads can all be purchased on AliExpress or Amazon for a reasonable price).

DIY Build Parts:
	ESP32 Dev Board
	Max98357 Breakout Board
	Arduino Compatible Keypad
	4 LEDs + Required Resistors

Usage:
Top 4 buttons are Function buttons, the rest are not trigger / selection.
For example, pressing F1 and then any of the buttons in the bottom 3 rows will switch instrumets,
F3 + any other function button will switch tracks, F4 will play and stop the track.  Full instructions coming soon, have fun exploring!
